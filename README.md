## Growth Exercise

Here different network growth types are investigated: 
  1. Network growth (New node with m open links) with random attachment.
  2. BA scale-free network.
      This works by drawing n random samples from the links vector and attach the new node to what the links is attached to.
      Thus nodes who already have many links will experience more growth.
  3. Modified Preferential growth
  4. Random modified growth: Network growth process with random link attachment


Below are some plotted results for the different growth types. The explanation for some of the variables are:
- N, is the number of nodes in the network
- The clustering coefficient, C, is a "measure for local connectedness between neighbouring
nodes"
