A repository for containing complex networks exercises



## Growth Exercise

Here different network growth types are investigated: 
  1. Network growth (New node with m open links) with random attachment.
  2. BA scale-free network.
      This works by drawing n random samples from the links vector and attach the new node to what the links is attached to.
      Thus nodes who already have many links will experience more growth.
  3. Modified Preferential growth
  4. Random modified growth

The clustering coefficient, C, is a "measure for local connectedness between neighbouring
nodes"
